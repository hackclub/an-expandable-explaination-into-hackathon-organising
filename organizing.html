        As a <a href="#hackathons">:hackathon</a> organizer, there’s always
        hundreds of different things on your plate. As I was organizing

        wrote in my

            I&#39;ve got 500 things in “the back of my head”. I just keep
            stuffing things to do back there! Running a hackathon, there’s no
            one telling you what to do and when to do it like there is in
            school. Now that’s great and all, but it means I’m stressing about
            forgetting things and feel like absolute chaos all day every day.

        The goal of this post is help you cover the basics of your hackathon –
        food, venue, sponsorship etc. – and give you more time to focus on
        making the experience unique and magical.

      <h2 id="starting-out">👋🏼 Starting Out 👋🏼</h2>
      <p>
        Getting going can be a daunting task, you’re priority in the first few
        days of organizing a hackathon should be getting yourself setup to be
        successful.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-three-ws">The Three Ws</h3>
      <p>
        You’ve probably heard of the four Ws before: who, what, when and why? At
        the moment, don’t worry about the what, just ask yourself:
      </p>
      <ul>

          <a href="#attendees">:Who do I want attending my hackathon?</a>

      <p>
        To help get the ball rolling, nail down these tasks in the first few
        days:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Form a team of up-to five fellow organizers.</b> Approach friends
          and acquaintances who’d share your excitement and passion for your
          event. Set yourself up with a group chat and a shared to-do list.
          Avoid creating too big of a team, the
          <a href="#diminishing-returns">:law of diminishing returns</a> comes
          into play here.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Settle on a name.</b> Names can be controversial within teams,
          settle on one and stick to it. In my opinion, a good name can be said
          in one breath, it’s easy to identify what it is &amp; where it is from
          it and is unique.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Great examples of names include: Windy City Hacks, RockHacks and
              Beantown Bash.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t overthink the name, though, it doesn’t make too much of a
              difference to the event in the end.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create a <a href="#hack-club-bank">:Hack Club Bank</a> account</b>:
          the best tool for raising and spending money as you organize.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Set your team up with Google Workspace (to use Gmail with custom
              domains, Drive etc.) accounts, all for free with Bank.
            </li>
            <li>
              Claim a free domain for your hackathon from Bank’s promotions tab.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >Join the <code>#hackathon-organizers</code> channel on the
            <a href="#hack-club-slack">:Hack Club Slack</a>.</b
          >
          There you’ll be able get support from your fellow organizers with the
          peculiar challenges a hackathon organizer faces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create a spreadsheet to keep track of your event’s finances.</b> To
          get a sense of where you’ll be spending money, check out Assemble’s
          budget. If you’re looking for a budget template,
          <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c8hVq5aW-XMdRhg4BKCCfj-qA-CE857_ov5vCjM7DQg/edit?usp=sharing"
            >here’s the template I normally use (based on MLH’s)</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create a basic website</b> with: your hackathon’s name, a two-line
          description of a hackathon, a form to register interest (don’t
          over-engineer it, an Airtable Form or Google Form will suffice) and
          approximate dates.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Aim for appealing, though minimalistic, design. You want this
              website up and running ASAP.
            </li>
            <li>
              You’ll be able to build a more substantial website with more time,
              but don’t let that hold you back from starting an online presence.
              Once you do,
              <a href="https://github.com/lachlanjc">@lachlanjc</a> has

      <h2 id="finding-a-venue">📍 Finding a Venue 📍</h2>
      <p>
        Setting off to find a venue is one hell of an adventure, it’ll lead you
        to all sorts of places but in the end you will find one.
      </p>
      <p>To get going, try your hand at the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Draft a two paragraph email that pitches your hackathon to prospective
          venues. Cover the basics, who, what, when &amp; why, in a succinct
          manner. Here’s the email we used
          <a href="#assemble-email">:for Assemble</a> &amp;
          <a href="#lion-city-hacks-email">:for Lion City Hacks</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a list of twenty spaces in your area that could serve as
          venues. Don’t be afraid to think outside of the box, most spaces can
          be
          <a href="#codeday-venue">:converted</a> into a hackathon venue from
          stadiums to cinemas!
          <ol>
            <li>
              At this stage, also consider if you know anyone who could help you
              with a venue or has a friend who could. Take advantage of any
              connection you have, who know where it could lead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Look around, where are the other tech events in your city being
              hosted? Browse <a href="https://meetup.com">meetup.com</a> to see
              if there are any common venues and add them to your list.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ideally, your venue will have: a large room for ceremonies,
              smaller rooms for workshops, open space (with chairs, tables,
              couches etc.) for hacking and a space to serve food.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Send your email to each space on your list. Do your best to
          personalise it but don’t spend more than fifteen minutes on each.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your eye on your inbox over the next couple of days. Don’t get
          anything back? Send follow-ups and repeat the steps above. If your
          emails aren’t working, get feedback from others (<code
            >#hackathon-organizers</code
          >
          is a great place) and iterate on them.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Finding a venue is tough and stressful. Trust me, you’ll be able to make
        it work. Just keep trying and don’t be afraid to try something crazy,
        someone will say yes and all the work will pay off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have heard back from someone and they’re interested, jump on a
        phone call to <a href="#venue-details">:iron out the details</a>. And
        you’re all set, well done on getting a venue secured and ready to go for
        the day!
      </p>
      <h2 id="raising-money">💸 Raising Money 💸</h2>
      <p>
        Hackathons need money and as we all know, money doesn’t grow on trees.
        Instead, hackathon organizers raise money through sponsorships from
        local businesses, startups and larger technology corporations.
      </p>
      <a href="https://bank.hackclub.com/assemble" target="_blank"
        ><img
          src="https://cloud-2tyh8nh8v-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2022-11-04_at_2.12.07_pm.png"
          alt="Assemble Transparent Hack Club Bank Finances"
      /></a>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: center;
          width: 100%;
          font-size: smaller;
          margin-top: 0px;
        "
      >
        <i>Assemble's transparent finances on Hack Club Bank</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming you’ve got
        <a href="#hack-club-bank">:Hack Club Bank</a> setup (<a
          href="https://bank.hackclub.com/apply"
          >apply</a
        >
        if you haven’t!), the first step of this sponsorship process is to
        create a <a href="#prospectus">:prospectus</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are a couple of great examples. As always take inspiration from
        them, but, don’t copy them verbatim, your event is unique!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://lelandhacks.com/prospectus.pdf">Leland Hacks</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://2019.hackpenn.com/prospectus.pdf"
            >Hack Pennsylvania</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://2019-site.windyhacks.com/prospectus.pdf"
            >Windy City Hacks</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you’ve got a <a href="#prospectus">:prospectus</a>, the process is
        similar to finding venues: draft a meaningful email, create a list of
        folks to reach out to, send them emails as personalised as possible and
        then follow up / repeat the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expect it to take a while for money to show up in your bank account,
        likely weeks but maybe months. As I said earlier just keep trying and
        once you’ve lined up sponsorships, make sure to express your
        <a href="#assemble-thank-you">:full appreciation</a> (sponsors love
        photos!).
      </p>
      <h2 id="legal-safety">🔓 Legal &amp; Safety</h2>
      <p>
        Collecting waivers and drafting safety policies isn&#39;t as fun as the
        rest of the organizing process. However, in the unlikely case of a
        problem, doing so now will help you a lot down the track.
      </p>
      <h3 id="waivers">📝 Waivers</h3>
      <p>
        To send out waivers and media releases (you’ll need these to stop
        yourself from getting sued and so you can take photos), set yourself up
        on a platform such as
        <a href="https://www.docusign.com/">DocuSign</a> and use
        <a
          href="https://cloud-ge1zv04u9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0hack_club_bank_event_liability_release.docx"
          >Hack Club’s pre-drafted legal form</a
        >. Two weeks before, send out waivers to participants and their parents.
        Keep track of those who sign wherever you’re storing registrations (<a
          href="https://airtable.com"
          >Airtable</a
        >
        is my personal recommendation).
      </p>
      <h3 id="code-of-conduct">🧸 Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>
        You’ll want to adopt a code of conduct to ensure all your attendees feel
        safe, comfortable and supported. I recommend forking
        <a href="#hack-club-code-of-conduct">:Hack Club’s Code of Conduct</a>,
        adapting it your needs (eg. change out the reporting method) and then
        publishing it on your website. Make the CoC visible in your opening
        ceremony and make sure your attendees know who to go to if they don’t
        feel comfortable.
      </p>
      <h3 id="covid-19">🦠 COVID-19</h3>
      <p>
        With COVID-19 still spreading, draft out a set of guidelines for how
        you’ll be reducing spread during your event to reassure and protect
        attendees.
        <a href="#assemble-covid-19">:Assemble’s is open-sourced</a>, as are
        many others on the internet. Fork one and adapt it to suit your needs
        and your region’s ongoing regulations / recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prepare for the unexpected, so if something goes wrong, you can handle
        the situation and ensure everyone attending is safe.
      </p>
      <h2 id="stocking-your-event">📦 Stocking Your Event 📦</h2>
      <p>
        Ok… back to the fun stuff! Shopping! Some of you may find that fun,
        normally I wouldn’t, but shopping for a hackathon is amazing.

      <h3 id="supplies">🛠 Supplies</h3>
      <p>
        A hackathon needs a lot of supplies, for example plates to serve food on
        and Arduino boards for workshops. I recommend creating a
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >procurement sheet</a
        >
        with everything you need and where you’ll buy it. Then go out with your
        <a href="#hack-club-bank">:Hack Club Bank</a>
        card and buy it! Don’t know what to buy? You can take inspiration from
        <a

          >the supplies we brought at Assemble</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h3 id="food">🌯 Food</h3>
      <p>
        Food is where you’re going to be spending most of your cash. Do your
        best to cover each major meal (breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner) and
        provide snacks and drinks at anytime.
      </p>
      <p>
        For lunch and dinner, try to spend $10 and $12 respectively per person.
        Work with both local restaurants (preferable, but slightly harder) and
        chain restaurants to find the best food within your budget. If you can
        get a restaurant to sponsor a meal that’s great, though difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        For breakfast, snacks and drinks, head to a nearby Costco (or the local
        alternative) and buy a bunch of items in bulk. Bagels, muffins and
        cereal all work for breakfast. I’d buy around 300ml of beverage per
        person per large meal being served and one snack per person for every
        four hours of your hackathon.
      </p>
      <h3 id="swag">✨ Swag</h3>
      <p>
        I’d encourage you to get creative and make the swag at your event
        unique, that said, finding supplies for swag can be a challenge. I
        highly recommend StickerMule, they’re slightly expensive but reliably
        deliver high quality swag. They also have
        <a
          href="https://www.stickermule.com/support/will-you-sponsor-my-organization#hackathons"
        >
          hackathon sponsorship options</a
        >. From friends I’ve also heard good things about
        <a href="https://www.smartypass.com/">SmartyPass</a>,
        <a href="https://www.brandmakers.com/">BrandMakers</a>
        and <a href="https://stickerhd.com/en/">StickerHD</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="marketing-your-event">📢 Marketing Your Event 📢</h2>
      <p>
        Every hackathon needs attendees, you could have 15 attendees, 50
        attendees or 175+ attendees. I've run hackathons with each of these
        attendee counts. Larger isn’t always better. Small hackathons, when done
        right, can be incredibly special for both attendees and organizers. As
        you start to market, set yourself a target for how many attendees you’d
        like at your event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marketing is then, essentially, trial and error. Try
        <a href="#marketing-methods">:different methods</a>
        of getting your hackathon in front of prospective attendees. Ask
        yourself, if someone wanted to market an event to me, how would they
        reach me? The answer to that question is most likely the marketing
        strategy you should be pursuing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around 50% of people who register will show up on the day, keep that in
        mind as you plan out numbers.
      </p>
      <h2 id="leading-a-team">🤝 Leading A Team 🤝</h2>
      <p>
        By far and away the toughest part of organizing a hackathon a team.
        Everyone’s counting on you and the buck stops with you. At the same
        time, somehow you’ve got to keep track of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s what I’d recommend, based on what I’ve found works and what I’ve
        previously failed to do (we’re all learning!):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Delegate the tasks and have faith in your team to get them done at a
          high quality. Help them improve through kind feedback and
          collaboration, don’t try to take everything on yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be clear and purposeful with your communication. Think through what
          you say and make sure it’s achieving what you want it to achieve.
        </li>
        <li>
          Show your appreciation for your team from day one all the way to the
          end. Shout them out and compliment them when they do great stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be caring and empathetic, you’re all high schoolers, make sure to put
          yourself in their shoes and help from there.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get everyone around the table as frequently as possible to discuss the
          event and give each other updates. If possible, setup a weekly meeting
          with the whole team. This will help with accountability as well as
          clarity, for yourself and your team.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Leading has been a personal struggle of mine for years. Remain authentic
        and kind, never stop learning / improving, and set an example for your
        team. With those three characteristics, you’ll do amazing.
      </p>
      <h2 id="a-smooth-day-of">🌟 A Smooth Day-of 🌟</h2>
      <p>
        You’ve done the hard yards and you’re finally here. Congratulations, now
        let’s make this day run as smooth as possible so you and your attendees
        can have a great time.
      </p>
      <h3 id="run-of-show">📜 Run of Show</h3>
      <p>
        A run of show is a breakdown of your event in fifteen or thirty minute
        blocks. What’s happening when?
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yzOWtqHE9J9zVvyj6X0cs0AGMFE4TH2jPIh_np9LWRg/edit?usp=sharing"
          target="_blank"
          >Here is Assemble’s</a
        >
        to base yours off.
      </p>
      <p>Creating a Run of Show helps with two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Visualising your event and spotting flaws in your current plan.
            Creating the document forces you to think everything. It’s best to
            spot flaws before the day instead of as they happen!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Knowing what you’ve got to do at every moment of the event, as it
            plays out. The same applies to your team, an RoS helps them know
            what they’ve got to do. Just make sure to communicate the RoS
            clearly to your team.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="team-delegation-communication">
        🐝 Team Delegation &amp; Communication
      </h3>
      <p>
        You’ll also want to make sure that everyone knows what they’re going to
        be doing on the day. Don’t pile everything on yourself, spread the load
        out. You’ll enjoy the event more if you get an opportunity to chat with
        all of your fabulous attendees.
      </p>
      <p>
        For larger events or events with larger venues, set up a threaded Slack
        or Discord channel to communicate with your team. WhatsApp can also work
        if your team is small. Some friends swear by walkie-talkies, you may
        want to try those out but be warned of long term hearing loss.

        <h1 id="hackathons">Hackathons</h1>
        <p>
          A hackathon is a social coding marathon where teenagers come together
          to build projects in a short amount of time and share them with the
          world.
        </p>
        <h1 id="attendees">Attendees</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Consider whether your attendees will be high schoolers, middle
            schoolers, university student etc. You can always have a combination
            of these groups, though I wouldn’t try to include all three.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider how technical your attendees will be, this fact will play a
            major role in shaping the event you deliver and how it’s marketed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="why">Why</h1>
        <p>
          Authentic motivation is the main ingredient of an amazing hackathon.
          Without being too much of a downer, if you don’t deeply care about
          your event and the story behind it, your hackathon likely won’t pan
          out too well.
        </p>
        <h1 id="when">When</h1>
        <p>
          Consider when’s best for your target audience as well as yourself.
          organizing a hackathon during exam week is tough, I say from
          experience. Make sure to give yourself at least two months (ideally
          three months) to prepare everything for the event.

        </p>
        <p>Hey Dylan!</p>
        <p>
          Sam &amp; Belle, here, we work with Christina Asquith &amp; Zach Latta
          at Hack Club. Every summer Hack Club runs something special. In 2020,
          we ran<a href="https://summer.hackclub.com/"> Summer of Making</a> and
          in 2021, we traveled across America on<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BID8_pGuqA"
          >
            The Hacker Zephyr</a
          >. This year we want to combine Summer of Making’s scale / impact and
          The Hacker Zephyr’s IRL magic at Assemble, Hack Club’s 2022 summer
          event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assemble will bring together 150 high school hackers from around the
          globe for a three-day magical hackathon in San Francisco this summer.
          You can expect the traditional Hack Club antics and more. For example,
          we’re looking at having a life-sized dinosaur robot (that hackers can
          hack on over the event) rove the event! Not only will Assemble be a
          magical hackathon, it’ll also set the gold standard for future
          high-school hackathons. Our goal is to redesign the blueprint for
          future hackathons: every component of Assemble will be open sourced
          (similar to<a href="https://github.com/hackclub/the-hacker-zephyr">
            The Hacker Zephyr repository</a
          >) and carefully documented for future organizers to bring to their
          own communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assemble needs a home in San Francisco and we were wondering if Figma
          could host us for a weekend (Friday 6:00pm to 12:30pm on Sunday) in
          late July / early August at your office in SF?
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember hearing about your rapping at the Figma Variety Show during
          the Hack Club AMA, that’s the exact vibe we’re going for at Assemble!
          Alongside the photos we’ve seen on social media and us all using Figma
          on the regular, the Figma office is shaping up to be the perfect venue
          for Assemble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for considering our request and we look forward to hearing
          from you! We would love to jump on a call to answer any questions or
          iron out details.

          <strong>Subject</strong>: Bringing Together Teenage Hackers @ RedHat
        </p>
        <p>Hey Harish,</p>
        <p>
          Sam here, I&#39;m a 17-year old student in Singapore. Last month I
          organized
          <a href="https://twitter.com/figma/status/1556774728072761344"
            >Assemble</a
          >, the first in-person high school hackathon in San Francisco since
          the start of the pandemic. My team &amp; I brought together hundreds
          of teenagers from 12 countries and 20+ US states for a magical
          weekend. I was so inspired after coming home from the event, that
          I&#39;ve decided to organize a hackathon for teenagers here in
          Singapore.
        </p>
        <p>

            alt=""
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          To make this happen, I&#39;ve brought together a team of secondary
          school &amp; JC students passionate about technology and raised just
          under $10,000 for the event. There&#39;s only one thing left to make
          the event a reality, the venue and that&#39;s where I need your help.
          I was wondering if you could help us find a way for RedHat to host us
          for a Saturday (8:00am to 9:00pm) in late November / early December?
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;d love to jump on a call to answer any questions or discuss
          details.Thank you for considering my ask!

        <h1 id="venue-details">Venue Details</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ensure they have everything you’ll need for the event. WiFi, power
            ports and a projector are the main ones. You may also want a speaker
            and a microphone. If they don’t have something, you can always
            improvise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check if there are any weird quirks about their office. Building
            security systems can be incredibly frustrating, make sure you
            understand how your venue’s security works.
          </li>
          <li>
            Book the venue for the event’s entire length plus three to four
            hours for setup and teardown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set expectations for your venue so there are no surprises on the
            day. Minors and staying overnight are normally the biggest surprises
            for venues, make your event incredibly clear for your point of
            contact.

        </ul>

        <p><strong>Why have a Code of Conduct?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Hack Club&#39;s community includes people from many different
          backgrounds. The Hack Club contributors are committed to providing a
          friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age,
          disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar
          personal characteristic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline
          standard of behavior so that people with different social values and
          communication styles can communicate effectively, productively, and
          respectfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in
          the community when they arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community
          welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical
          in order for us to build a thriving community; for Hack Club to be
          successful, it needs hackers from all backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and
          debate. The Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence
          others with whom they disagree.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Where does the Code of Conduct apply?</strong></p>
        <p>
          If you join in or contribute to the Hack Club ecosystem in any way,
          you are encouraged to follow the Code of Conduct while doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to all official
          online Hack Club groups, in-person meetings, and events including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a href="https://hackclub.com/slack/">Slack</a></li>
          <li>
            The <a href="https://events.hackclub.com/">Events</a>, including
            <a href="https://hackclub.com/amas/">AMAs</a>,
            <a href="https://hackclub.com/night/">Hack Night</a>, &amp; Zoom
            calls on Slack
          </li>
          <li>The <a href="https://github.com/hackclub">GitHub projects</a></li>
          <li>Club Meetings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Other Hack Club groups (such as hackathons, conferences, meetups, and
          other unofficial forums) are encouraged to adopt this Code of Conduct.
          Those groups must provide their own moderators and/or working group
          (see below).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Hacker Values</strong></p>
        <p>
          These are the values to which people in the Hack Club community should
          aspire.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be friendly and welcoming</li>
          <li>
            Be patient
            <ul>
              <li>
                Remember that people have varying communication styles and that
                not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone
                can be lost in translation).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Be thoughtful
            <ul>
              <li>
                Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your
                words will be interpreted.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from
                commenting.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Be respectful
            <ul>
              <li>In particular, respect differences of opinion.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Be charitable
            <ul>
              <li>
                Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to
                disagree.
              </li>
              <li>When we do disagree, try to understand why.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid destructive behavior:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something
                else, start a new conversation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unconstructive criticism: don&#39;t merely condemn the current
                state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to
                how things may be improved.
              </li>
              <li>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)</li>
              <li>
                Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all
                too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
              </li>
              <li>
                Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and
                environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory
                or negative slights and insults to a person or group.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to
          misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to
          be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense
          was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent
          was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of
          <em>all parties</em> to de-escalate conflict when it arises.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Unwelcome behavior</strong></p>
        <p>These actions are explicitly forbidden in Hack Club spaces:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Expressing or provoking:
            <ul>
              <li>insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks;</li>
              <li>
                discrimination based on age, nationality, race, (dis)ability,
                gender (identity or expression), sexuality, religion, or similar
                personal characteristic;
              </li>
              <li>bullying or systematic harassment;</li>
              <li>
                unwelcome sexual advances, including sexually explicit content.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

            etc - unless specifically given permission by Hack Club HQ.
          </li>
          <li>
            Posting spam-like content that disrupts the environment of the
            community.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Moderation &amp; Enforcement</strong></p>
        <p>
          Please understand that speech and actions have consequences, and
          unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. When you participate in
          <a href="#where-does-the-code-of-conduct-apply"
            >areas where the code of conduct applies</a
          >, you should act in the spirit of the &quot;Hacker values&quot;. If
          you conduct yourself in a way that is explicitly forbidden by the Code
          of Conduct, you will be warned and asked to stop, and your messages
          may be removed by community moderators. Repeated offenses may result
          in a temporary or permanent ban from the community.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On your first offense, you will receive a written notice from one of
            our community moderators. Depending on the degree of the reported
            behavior, you may be asked to apologize, either in public or
            directly to the party that you have offended.
          </li>
          <li>
            On a second offense, you will be temporarily removed from the
            community. The period of the temporary ban may vary from 3 days to a
            month, decided based on the seriousness of the reported behavior.
            Please note that this ban
            <strong
              >does not indicate that you are no longer welcomed in the
              community</strong
            >
            - it represents an official warning for your behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            On a third offense, you may be asked to leave the community. Your
            account may be suspended for an indefinite amount of time, and you
            may be publicly identified.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This procedure only serves as a general guideline for moderation &amp;
          enforcement of our community conduct. Under all circumstances, the
          Working Group or Hack Club&#39;s staff members may take any action we
          deem appropriate, including immediate removal from the community.
          Being banned from the Hack Club community may also prevent you from
          participating in our community events, including but not restricted
          to: local club meetings, hackathons, or challenges.

        <p><strong>Working Group</strong></p>
        <p>
          The Working Group is responsible for handling conduct-related issues.
          Their mission is to de-escalate conflicts and try to resolve issues to
          the satisfaction of all parties. For all
          <a href="#where-does-the-code-of-conduct-apply"
            >projects related to and/or maintained by Hack Club HQ</a
          >, the Working Group is made up of the

        <p><strong>Reporting Issues</strong></p>
        <p>
          If you encounter a conduct-related issue, you should report it to the
          Working Group using the process described below.
          <strong>Do not</strong> post about the issue publicly or try to rally
          sentiment against a particular individual or group.

                Should you choose to remain anonymous then the Working Group
                cannot notify you of the outcome of your report.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may contact a member of the group directly if you do not
                feel comfortable contacting the group as a whole. That member
                will then raise the issue with the Working Group as a whole,
                preserving the privacy of the reporter (if desired).
              </li>
              <li>
                If your report concerns a member of the Working Group they will

                The Working Group will strive to handle reports with discretion

                and to avoid conflicts of interest.

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You should receive a response within 48 hours (likely sooner).
            (Should you choose to contact a single Working Group member, it may
            take longer to receive a response.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The Working Group will meet to review the incident and determine
            what happened.
            <ul>
              <li>
                With the permission of person reporting the incident, the

                context.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Working Group will reach a decision as to how to act. These

                  <li>Nothing.</li>
                  <li>A request for a private or public apology.</li>

                  <li>
                    An imposed vacation (for instance, asking someone to abstain
                    for a week from the Slack or a GitHub project).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Hack Club

            Below is the COVID-19 policy we adopted at Assemble. It was written
            to keep attendees safe whilst also being practical enough for us to
            implement. To the best of our knowledge (after contact tracing),
            there was no COVID-19 transmission at Assemble.

          Documentation and implementation is handled by the
          <strong>COVID working group</strong>. If you have any questions, or
          need to contact someone about these docs, please reach out to them.

          <strong><em>Before the Hackathon</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Vaccination Requirements</strong></p>
        <p>
          All attendees will be required to submit proof of full vaccination
          including additional boosters that may become available and
          recommended before August. Attendees may be asked to show proof at a
          pre-event check-in and at the entrance of the venue, so
          <strong>attendees should bring their proof of vaccination</strong>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Covid Test Documentation</strong></p>
        <p>
          We require all attendees &amp; organizers produce the results of a
          negative antigen test within 24 hours of the event or (if flying)
          before you leave to travel.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Travel Stipends</strong></p>
        <p>
          Recipients of travel stipends flying in to attend will need to take
          their tests before boarding their plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>At the Hackathon</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Resources</strong></p>
        <p>
          Rapid tests will be provided in the open for anyone to use and hand
          sanitizer will be located throughout the venue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Masks are not required at the venue, but will be available for anyone
          who wishes to wear one.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Self-report Response</strong></p>
        <p>
          If an attendee or organizer begins to show symptoms and/or has a
          positive test, they must isolate and leave the event. They are
          responsible for coordinating housing and rebooking travel if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will send a notification email to attendees with exposure details
          if there is a positive test.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>After the Hackathon</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Reporting post-event positive-tests</strong></p>
        <p>
          If an attendee or organizer has a positive test within 7 days of the
          event, they should report the possible exposure to
          <a href="https://airtable.com/shr7cGWMSKPTGrGe4">self-report link</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure attendees and organizers remember to self-report after the
          event, a scheduled text message will be sent with the
          <a href="https://airtable.com/shr7cGWMSKPTGrGe4">self-report link</a>.

        <h1 id="marketing-methods">Marketing Methods</h1>
        Some common strategies used are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Emailing nearby school teachers personally. Teachers are often the
            most direct method of reaching teenagers, though your mileage may
            vary. Reaching out to them is a lot like pitching to venues and
            sponsors, if things aren’t working, iterate on your email.
          </li>
          <li>
            Posting in groups on Reddit, Telegram, Facebook , NextDoor etc.
            Places where teenagers frequent are preferable. Though, parents can
            be another way to reach teenagers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Getting onto hackathon directories, such as hackathons.hackclub.com.
            This will help folks already interested in hackathons find your
            event.
            <ul>
              <li>
                On a similar note, check your website’s SEO and make sure your
                showing up for the query “[city / region name] high school
                hackathon”.
